**branch-watch** (`bw`) is a fast, single-binary CLI tool that tells you — at a glance — whether your GitHub branches are behind `main`, how far your forks have drifted from upstream, and what pull requests are open. No browser required. Powered by the GitHub REST API.

> **TL;DR** — Run `bw forks` to see all your forked repos vs. upstream. Run `bw branches owner/repo` to see every branch vs. the default branch. Run `bw prs owner/repo` for open PRs.

---

## Why branch-watch?

Keeping track of GitHub branch and fork sync status manually is tedious:

- You maintain **multiple forks** of open-source projects and need to know which ones are stale
- Your team has **dozens of feature branches** and you want to catch the ones that have drifted before they become impossible to merge
- You want to check open PR status **without leaving the terminal**

branch-watch solves all three with a single command.

## What's New in v0.2.0

- **`--behind-only` filter** — show only branches or forks that are actually behind; skip the noise
- **`--json` output** — pipe results into `jq`, scripts, or CI steps
- **gh CLI token auto-detection** — if you already have `gh` installed and authenticated, `bw` just works with no extra setup
- **PR age display** — each PR now shows its open date so you can spot staleness at a glance
- **Sorted by staleness** — branches and forks are ranked by how many commits behind they are, worst first
- **Clearer auth errors** — expired token, wrong scope, and missing token all give actionable error messages

## Demo

### Check if all your forks are behind upstream

```
$ bw forks

Forked repositories

  alice/rust          rust-lang/rust        ↓ 42 behind
  alice/tokio         tokio-rs/tokio        ↓ 7 behind   ↑ 2 ahead
  alice/serde         serde-rs/serde        ✓ in sync
  acme/axum           tokio-rs/axum         ↓ 15 behind  ↑ 8 ahead
  acme/reqwest        seanmonstar/reqwest   ↑ 3 ahead
```

Filter to only stale forks:

```
$ bw forks --behind-only

Forked repositories

  alice/rust          rust-lang/rust   ↓ 42 behind
  acme/axum           tokio-rs/axum   ↓ 15 behind  ↑ 8 ahead
  alice/tokio         tokio-rs/tokio  ↓ 7 behind   ↑ 2 ahead
```

### Check branch sync status vs. main

```
$ bw branches owner/repo

→ owner/repo (base: main)

  feature/auth        ↓ 3 behind  ↑ 2 ahead
  feat/dashboard      ↓ 14 behind
  fix/login           ✓ up to date
```

### List open pull requests

```
$ bw prs owner/repo

→ owner/repo — 2 open PRs

  #101  Add dark mode support
         feat/dark-mode → main  by @alice · 2 reviewers · opened 2026-03-01

  #98   Fix login redirect [draft]
         fix/login → main  by @bob · opened 2026-04-10
```

### Machine-readable JSON output

```
$ bw branches owner/repo --json | jq '.[] | select(.behind > 10)'
{
  "branch": "feat/dashboard",
  "base": "main",
  "behind": 14,
  "ahead": 0
}
```

```sh
brew install nuri-yoo/tap/branch-watch
```

```sh
pip install branch-watch
```

```sh
npm install -g branch-watch
```

### Pre-built binaries — direct download

Download from the [releases page](https://github.com/nuri-yoo/branch-watch/releases):

| Platform | Binary |
|----------|--------|
| macOS Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4/M5) | `branch-watch-*-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz` |
| macOS Intel | `branch-watch-*-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz` |
| Linux x86_64 | `branch-watch-*-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz` |
| Linux ARM64 | `branch-watch-*-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz` |

```sh
tar xzf branch-watch-*.tar.gz
sudo mv bw /usr/local/bin/
```

### Build from source — for Rust developers

Requires [Rust](https://rustup.rs) 1.80+.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nuri-yoo/branch-watch
cd branch-watch
cargo install --path .
```

---

## Authentication

branch-watch uses the GitHub REST API and requires a Personal Access Token (PAT) with `repo` scope.

**Generate a token**: [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) → Generate new token → select `repo`

**Option 1 — gh CLI auto-detection (zero setup):**

If you already have the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) installed and logged in, `bw` picks up your token automatically. No extra configuration needed.

```sh
gh auth login   # one-time setup if not already done
bw forks        # works immediately
```

**Option 2 — Save to config file (persistent):**

```sh
bw auth ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
# Saved to ~/.branch-watch.toml
```

**Option 3 — Environment variable:**

```sh
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
bw forks
```

Token priority: config file → `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var → gh CLI

## Usage

### `bw forks` — check if your GitHub forks are behind upstream

Lists all repositories you have forked and compares each one to its upstream default branch. Results are sorted by how many commits behind, worst first.

```sh
bw forks
bw forks --behind-only          # show only stale forks
bw forks --json                 # machine-readable output
bw forks --behind-only --json   # combine flags
```

**When to use**: After returning from vacation, before syncing forks, or when maintaining many open-source forks simultaneously.

### `bw branches` — check if branches are behind main

Shows the sync status of every branch in a repository relative to the default branch (usually `main` or `master`). Sorted by commits behind, worst first.

```sh
bw branches owner/repo
bw branches owner/repo --behind-only
bw branches owner/repo --json
```

**When to use**: Before a sprint planning session, during code review, or when cleaning up stale branches.

### `bw prs` — list open pull requests

Lists all open pull requests sorted oldest-first, with author, source → target branch, draft indicator, reviewer count, and open date.

```sh
bw prs owner/repo
bw prs owner/repo --json
```

**When to use**: Daily standup, PR review sessions, or release preparation.

### `bw auth` — save GitHub token

```sh
bw auth <token>
```

## Use in GitHub Actions

branch-watch is available on the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/branch-watch). Add it to any workflow to automatically check branch sync status in CI:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: nuri-yoo/branch-watch@v1
    with:
      command: branches          # branches | forks | prs
      repo: ${{ github.repository }}
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

**Use cases in CI:**
- Fail a build if feature branches are more than N commits behind `main`
- Post a daily Slack summary of fork sync status
- Block merges when a branch is significantly out of date

---

## Versioning and Releases

branch-watch uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). When a `v*` tag is pushed, the release workflow automatically:

1. Builds binaries for all 4 platforms (macOS arm64/x86_64, Linux x86_64/arm64)
2. Creates a GitHub Release with attached binaries
3. Publishes to PyPI (`pip install branch-watch`)
4. Publishes to npm (`npm install -g branch-watch`)
5. Updates the Homebrew formula with correct SHA256 checksums

To release a new version:

```sh
git tag v0.2.0
git push origin v0.2.0
```

Everything else is automated.

## FAQ

**How do I check if my GitHub fork is behind upstream?**
Run `bw forks`. It lists every fork in your GitHub account and shows how many commits it is behind or ahead of the upstream repository.

**How do I check if a branch is behind main on GitHub?**
Run `bw branches owner/repo`. It compares every branch in the repository against the default branch and shows behind/ahead commit counts.

**Do I need to run `bw auth` if I already use the GitHub CLI?**
No. If `gh` is installed and authenticated, branch-watch detects the token automatically. `bw auth` is only needed if you don't use the GitHub CLI.

**Does branch-watch work with private repositories?**
Yes. Any private repository your GitHub token has `repo` scope access to will work.

**Does branch-watch support GitHub Enterprise Server?**
Not yet. Currently supports github.com only.

**What is the difference between branch-watch and `git fetch --prune`?**
`git fetch` requires a local clone of the repository. branch-watch queries the GitHub API remotely — no local clone needed. It also works across all your repositories at once.

**Can I pipe the output to other tools?**
Yes. Use `--json` to get structured output and pipe it to `jq`, `grep`, or any other tool.

**Does branch-watch support GitLab or Bitbucket?**
No. branch-watch is built specifically for the GitHub REST API.

**Is branch-watch free?**
Yes. branch-watch is open-source under the MIT license.
